# Piano Lessons with Greg Kaighin
## Prototype build v1.0
## January 2021

This project is a prototype build of Piano Lessons with Greg Kaighin website, the latest version of which can be found here:

https://github.com/GregKaighin/piano-lessons-with-greg-kaighin-2.0-msp1-code-institute

I decided to start the project again in a new repository upon realising that it was going to be much easier to achieve a responsive layout
using Bootstrap.

This design of this website is in part based on the Love Running website featured in Code Institute's Full Stack Developer programme.
