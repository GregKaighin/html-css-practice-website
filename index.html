                    I have more than twenty years of experience as a teacher.
                    I studied at Leeds College of Music and gained a BA (Hons) degree in Jazz Studies.

            <h2>About me <i class="fas fa-user"></i></h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Hello my name is Greg Kaighin, I am an experienced tutor who has been teaching
                piano for more than twenty years.
                I am happy to teach people of all ages and abilities from beginners to advanced. Each of my pupils
                follows a dynamic tailor-made learning plan designed for making effective and enjoyable musical
                progress.</p>
            <p>My aim is to equip pupils with the skills, knowledge and mindset necessary to become independent
                musicians capable of following their own interest in music. This is achieved by developing a broad range
                of skills in performance, sight-reading, aural-awareness, composition and improvisation. I use modern
                teaching methods and books in addition to my own materials. I teach classical, popular and jazz piano
                music. Preparation for grade exams is available. I am also able to teach lessons in music theory and
                music technology.</p>
            <p>I am DBS-checked and my certificate is available to view on request.
                Lessons are available either online via Zoom, or in your own home if you live in the Bedfordshire area.
                For beginner to intermediate level pupils, one 30-minute lesson each week is appropriate. For advanced
                pupils 60-minute lessons are recommended.</p>
            <p>I am also a professional musician and run my own band.</p>
            <p>If you are interested in piano lessons for yourself or your child, please get in contact using the <a
                    href="enquiry.html">enquiry</a> form or send an email to <a
                    href="mailto:gregkaighin@hotmail.com">gregkaighin@hotmail.com</a>, and I will get back to you soon.
