            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Hello, my name is Greg Kaighin, thank you for visiting my website. I have a
                lifelong passion for music and have been
                playing the piano for over 30
                years and working as a professional musician and piano teacher for more than 20 of those years.
                I am happy to teach people of all ages and abilities from beginner to advanced. Each of my students
                follows a dynamic, tailor-made learning plan which is designed to enable effective and enjoyable musical
                progress.</p>
            <p>My goal is to equip my students with the skills, knowledge and mindset necessary to become independent
                musicians capable of following their own interest in music. This is achieved by developing a broad range
                of skills in performance, sight-reading, aural-awareness, composition and improvisation. I use modern
                teaching methods and books in addition to my own materials. I teach classical, popular and jazz piano
                music. Preparation for grade exams is available. I am also able to teach lessons in music theory and
                music technology.</p>
            <p>I am DBS-checked and my certificate is available to view on request.
                Lessons are available either online via Zoom, or in your own home if you live in the Bedfordshire area.
                For beginner to intermediate level students, one 30-minute lesson each week is appropriate. For advanced
                students 60-minute lessons are recommended.</p>
            <p>Tuition is available throughout the academic year including during school holidays if requested.
                Additional group workshops are held during school holidays in collaboration with other local teachers of
                different instruments, giving students an opportunity to participate in group music-making.</p>
            <p>If you are interested in piano lessons, or music theory/music technology lessons, then please get in
                contact using the <a href="enquiry.html">enquiry</a>
                form or send an email to <a href="mailto:gregkaighin@hotmail.com">gregkaighin@hotmail.com</a>, and I
                will get back to you soon.

                <p>
                    I have more than twenty years of experience as a teacher.
                    I studied at Leeds College of Music and gained a BA (Hons) degree in Jazz Studies.

                <p>
                    I have performed professionally for many years, both as a bandleader
                    and also accompanying well-known acts in shows around the UK.
