            <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Hello I’m Greg Kaighin, I am an experienced piano teacher who has been teaching for over twenty years.
                I enjoy teaching people of all ages and abilities from beginner to advanced level. Each of my pupils follows a dynamic tailor-made learning plan designed for effective and enjoyable musical progress.</p>
                <p>My aim is to equip pupils with the skills, knowledge and mindset necessary to become independent musicians capable of following their own interest in music. This is achieved by developing a set of skills in performance, sight-reading, composition, aural skills, improvisation and music theory. Preparation for graded examinations is available. I use modern teaching methods and books in addition to my own materials. I teach Western classical, popular and jazz piano music.</p>
                <p>I am DBS-checked and my certificate is available to view on request. 
                Lessons are available either online via Zoom, or in your own home if you live in the Bedfordshire area.
                I am also a professional musician and run my own band.</p>
                <p>For beginner to intermediate pupils, one 30-minute lesson each week is appropriate. For advanced pupils 60-minute lessons are recommended.</p>
                <p>If you are interested in piano lessons for yourself or your child, please do get in touch using the enquiry form on this website, or contact me by telephone on 07704849036, or send an email to <email>gregkaighin@hotmail.com</email>.
